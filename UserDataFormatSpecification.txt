User Data Format Specification

	The data format specificaiton is very important for later on data processing.
	The rule must be follow and invalid data will be filter out if it make problems.
	
	The schema definition: 
		SensorData=[|FieldName=FieldValue]+
		FieldValue=[FieldSubValue,]+
	
	Topic Naming rule: Sensors/SensorName	
	Device ID Naming rule: LASS-AnyNameYouPrefer
		System will apply LASS prefix filter in the future. The wrong devices ID will not get service. 
	Sensor naming rule: We use Grove sensor name as our rule, remove space. The detail list as below.
		refer http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_System
	Sensor data format: 
		The definition will be different in different sensor. 
		Should have common rule, but it should be list the data format in each sensor definition.
	New sensor: 
		Welcome to suggest new sensor format, or just use it. We will try to capture it in the data log and become new sensor format.
